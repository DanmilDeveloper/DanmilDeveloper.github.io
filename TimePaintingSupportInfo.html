<h4>TIME PAINTING: Color By Number</h4>
<h2>GAME MENU</h2>

<p>The player can choose between two coloring options with the same pictures but a slightly different principle. SAFE MODE (easier and slower): the mistakes do not count, and QUICK MODE (more difficult and faster): the mistakes are penalized. The game offers levels (A-H) + a bonus picture of a clock.</p>

<h2>COLORING</h2>

<p>At the beginning there is a light-grey field of tetragons or hexagons with a number or letter in each box. The player selects the color in the upper/left bar and then clicks into the grey field to replace individual numbers/letter by the corresponding color. One-finger touch means coloring the box/boxes, while one-finger flick will scroll or move the picture. Two-finger pinch or un-pinch will zoom the picture.</p>

<p>The player should try to color the picture as fast as possible. One of the principles how to achieve it, is to use area-coloring as much as possible (i.e. coloring of several boxes with a single touch). The game can be interrupted at any time by clicking on the box indicating the ticking time/number of uncolored boxes.</p>

<h2>SAFE MODE</h2>

<p>In order to correctly color several boxes together in safe mode, the player has to mark the border of the whole area to be colored (including the picture edges) in one color and the whole area has to contain only the numbers/letters corresponding to the color. After marking the border, click on the box with a drop which changes from an outlined drop to a drop with number one inside. All you need to do then is to click the corresponding color anywhere inside the bordered area to color it whole. The drop function in safe mode can be used to color one bordered area at a time. If a player makes a mistake in safe mode, the area is not colored wrongly.</p>

<h2>QUICK MODE</h2>

<p>In order to color correctly several boxes together, the player in quick mode needs to have the area marked (the border does not have to be in one color and the picture edges do not need to be colored). However, the area to be colored needs to contain all the same numbers/letters. The player then clicks on the drop. It changes from an outlined drop to a drop with number one inside. All you need to do then is to click the corresponding color anywhere inside the bordered area to color it whole. Area-coloring in safe mode has two variants: single use to color one area at a time (a drop with number one inside) and several uses to color more areas subsequently (a drop with plus inside). The drop box serves to change between these two area-coloring options. If a player makes a mistake in quick mode, the area is colored but the player cannot continue. UNDO/ERROR appears in the box with the time ticking/number of uncolored boxes. The player has to click on this box to get one step backwards and to erase the error. At the same time, however, penalizing seconds are added to the ticking time.</p>
